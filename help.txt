- This program models a pulley system with a cart and a hanging weight that
  demonstrates acceleration.
- There are various sliders that let you change the mass of the cart, the mass
  of the hanging weight, and the acceleration due to gravity.
- According to Newton's second law of motion, as the mass of the weight increases,
  the acceleration of the system should increase. As the mass of the cart increases,
  the acceleration should decrease.


- NOTE: one meter is equivalent to 5 pixels
